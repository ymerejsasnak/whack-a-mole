============

Whack-A-Mole: simple html/js game



TO DO:

-fix display so the status labels don't move when the numbers increase (ie 99 to 100)

-implement game end after level 10 (option to reload? or auto reload? or what?)

-maybe replace mouse cursor with mallet image (and seperate mallet image on mousedown?)

-refactor click event handler and game loop into respective functions

-implement high score (per session or use localstorage?)
