============

Whack-A-Mole: simple html/js game



TO DO:

-finish end game code --- simple solution: just hide remaining moles so user can view scores and reload at their leisure


-fix display so the status labels don't move when the numbers increase (ie 99 to 100)

-make seperate mallet image on mousedown? (so it looks like it's swinging)
